CAV (Contextual Analysis of Vulnerabilities) System (CAVS in short) aims to provide a simple to use frontend and backend (backend can work independently) that accepts a network vulnerability scan file, easy to use network topology configuration, and quick analysis of vulnerabilities based on the context of both severity using the CIA triad and the position of the device affected on the home network (using the network topology configuration). The output will display vulnerabilities ranked from most severe to least severe based on the context of the network and offer patch solution advice to tidy up and secure your network.
